gpoverview - at present is a POST posting number of cubicles but I'm sure could be simplified with GET processing cubicles locally

  args: cubicle: "number of cubicles requiring return - will query DB from cubicle 1-number"
  returns array [0-(number-1)] each representing 1 cubicle
    - total: total vaccines
    - thisvial: number given since counter reset
    - pervial: number of doses to be given this vial (usually 5 or 6)

dovaccinate - post
  args: cubicle: the number of the cubicle administering the vaccine
  returns array containing all timestamps for this cubicle (todo: return object containing array and also vial data above)

newvial - post (not written yet)
  args: cubicle: the number of the cubicles
        pervial: the number of vaccines which will be delivered (likely 5 or 6))

removejab - POST - remove specified timestamp (not written yet)
  args: cubicle
        timestamp
